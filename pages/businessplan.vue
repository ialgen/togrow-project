            <h2>Who are we</h2>
            <p>
                Wisdom Adabunu: I am student in International Economics and I co-imagined this start-up idea with Ialgen. I carry on marketing and public relations especially with Togolese.
                <br><br>Ialgen Allal: As the CTO, I will be in charge of providing a sleek and useful platform for our users in Togo and all around the world. 
            </p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>
                ​TOGrOw is based in France. We are developing the website with the French expertise in computer science. As TOGrOw is community based, it will have workers in Togo to provide multiple services to small businesses using the platform. Of course, TOGrOw aims at building bridges between the members of the Togolese diaspora around the world; it will then cross borders.
            </p>

            <h2>Broken bridge between supply and demand</h2>
            <p>
                Togo is a relatively small country when compared to wider African countries. However, Togo is known as the “small Africa” because of the significant diversity of its landscapes. In 2019, almost one million tourists went to Togo, therefore making the tourism contribution as 10% of the GDP this year. When covid-19 hit the global economy Togo was weakened by the sudden stop of tourists’ influx. Even though we are beginning to live with less restrictions in Europe, the bridge between our economy and African countries has been substantially severed. That is why we need to unearth a new way to link local craftsmanship with buyers in developed countries.
            </p>

            <h2>Issues we want to adress</h2>
            <p>
                We decided to create TOGrOw: a marketplace for Togolese artists and entrepreneurs that promotes African skills and creativity. 
                <br><br>This idea was facing various difficulties that we needed to solve: 
                <br>- The first one is the lack of entrepreneurship education in Africa. Indeed, in 2019: 75% of Togolese had vulnerable jobs which is related to the amount of the population working in the informal sector. Thus, there’s a pool of entrepreneurs that do not take full advantage of their ideas and don’t have the possibility or enough resources to educate themselves. 
                <br>- Secondly, tourism is an important source of revenue for the country, because the amount of revenue from tourism in 2019 was a little more than 269M In Togo.  
                <br>- Finally, our task is to reconcile the supplier and the buyer who were separated by the crisis. Indeed, the volume of flights decreased. That's why we need to unearth a new way to link local craftsmanship with buyers in developed countries. 
            </p>

            <h2>Our products</h2>
            <p>
                Our marketplace is as simple as it can be. Business accounts offer the possibilities to sell products for the customers to buy. We take a 20% fee on every transaction and it’s our only compensation for the maintenance and development of the marketplace. It is mainly used to pay our employees and the international transportation costs of the goods sold on the platform.
                <br><br>TOGrOw is committed to providing training based on business management. In a country where the literacy rate is only 66%, we believe that training our Togolese partners, who need it, is an action with high added value, both from a social and economic perspective. Indeed, acquiring the fundamentals of knowledge allows increased development for a small structure.
                <br><br>Small businesses in Togo need to industrialize in order to sustain their activity over time. By using the tools provided by the TOGrOw platform, craftsmen can focus on the manual work they already master and abandon the commercial management of the business. TOGrOw provides artisans with the customers they have lost because of the downturn in international tourism.
            </p>

            <h2>Marketing plan</h2>
            <p>
                To conquer this market, we built a strong and feet on the ground marketing plan based on our public. Indeed, our clients are either eager to discover the country or related to it by their origins. However, we cannot target a special age category which made us trade the classical social media promotion for other means.  
                <br><br>First, we want to reach the African diaspora by partnering with local embassies. Indeed, most Internationals need to stay in contact with their embassy for administrative purposes and setting art pieces from TOGROW to decorate the Togolese embassy at first would be a great window. Then, we will implement furniture in furniture stores in various districts such as Chateau Rouge or chip market of Saint-Ouen to reach diverse types of customers.  
                <br><br>Also, we are going to participate in Parisian fairs devoted to the promotion of African art and culture such as the AKAA (Also Known As Africa) at Le Carreau du temple, or “le Parcours des Mondes”. These events can drive a lot of funds towards Togolese artisans on the platform.  
                <br><br>Finally, the particularity of our marketplace is our cultural purpose. We wanted to offer Togolese artists a platform to share their music and talent in the world. This additional product doesn’t give us any profit, except that local artist could give us free promotion to their socials, but it is important for us to state that our platform is not just a marketplace, but a real cooperative that aims to help Togolese conquer other markets and get out of poverty.  
            </p>

            <h2>Market and competition analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Business to Consumer online marketplaces for physical goods exist and thrive in western economies. But the biggest marketplaces in the world, like Amazon, do not have a strong presence in Africa according to the International Trade Center, which means that there are more possibilities for local marketplaces. And even if some African marketplaces are quite successful, none of them aims at building a bridge between Africa and European economies. The value TOGrOw brings to the market isn’t about functionalities of the platform but more about services targeting a specific community. 
            </p>

            <h2>Our vision</h2>
            <p>
                We aim at creating not only value for shareholders but for all stakeholders. We envision a thriving business sector in sub-Saharan Africa. One which includes local suppliers in fair supply-chains, one which generates local employment.
                <br><br>Also, we’re willing to create an inclusive platform with TOGROW, that’s why we will partner with public organisations such as UN WOMEN to subsidize women entrepreneurship and participate in their empowerment.
                <br><br>In the future, we imagine implementing our marketplace in other African countries, maybe in 6 years when our activity will be profitable, we could reach the Ghana and Benin market. This would be eased by the small volume of other marketplace in Africa that are mainly centred on small areas of Africa.
            </p>

            <h2>Our core values</h2>
            <p>
                The empowerment of Togolese communities is a goal on the same level as being a profitable company. We believe that both wellbeing and high levels of creative production are bound.
                <br><br>While embracing our social values, we will not forget that protecting the environment is essential if we want to become a sustainable business. We are not accepting big industries on our platform, and we will make sure that every small business we work with respects and shares the same core values that we do.
                <br><br>We plan to get the B Corp certification because we want to participate in accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive sustainable economy. We believe that we can meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance while balancing profit and purpose.
